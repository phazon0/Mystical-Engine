### Information

This is a game engine i been working on for the past 3 months. It uses LWJGL 2.9 and is coded in java 8. 
The map is randomly generated. This includes the terrain, the trees and the gold in order to create a new experience for the players, everytime they launch the game.

Run the [run.bat](build) file if on windows
Otherwise run the following command but replace the natives with the right ones for your OS
```
java -jar -Djava.library.path="natives" "LWJGL game.jar"
```

### Objective

Find all the missing gold (40) by navigating around the map

### Controls

```
Movement = WASD
Rotate Yaw = Right, Left
Rotate Pitch = Up, Down
Sprint = Shift
Jump = Space
Change FOV = Scroll
Debug = F12

```
